The first thing comes to your mind is the module name e.g., FileLogger. The main functionality of the FileLogger module is to:

Open the log file.
Write log messages to the log file based on log level.
Close the log file.
To create  FileLogger module, you need to do the following steps:

First, create your own module name, in this case, you call it FileLogger.
Second, create a file named modulename.pm. In this case, you need to create a new file named  FileLogger.pm. pm stands for Perl module.
Third, make the FileLogger module a package by using the syntax:  package FileLogger; at the top of the  FileLogger.pm file.
Fourth, write the code for subroutines and variables, and put the code into the  FileLogger.pm file.
Fifth, put the last statement in the  FileLogger.pm file: 1; to make the file returns true.
